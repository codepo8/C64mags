<h2>17/01/2010 Update #8 available!</h2></p>
<p>The Ultimate C64 Scene Mag Archive is the most comprehensive and authoritative collection of magazines from the illusive yet dominate C64 scene underground. Its been around 1 year since the last update to the archive and we have collected some treats that have waited too long to be spread. I should also mention, that I would like to expand this archive further. If space is provided we could add all C64 commercial magazines like Commodore Format and Your Commodore (currently only selected titles are held in the archive like ZZAP!64).</p>

<h2>03/10/2008</h2>
<p>Our long serving FTP has disappeared (University of Budapest "Gangsta's Paradise") so we migrated over to the Padua's FTP "Goin' For Gold".</p>
<p>As a result, all files are now downloadable again, including the updated main file (check the Downloads section for the big files and Mags for individual).</p>
